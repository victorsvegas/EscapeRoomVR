If you copy all of the files in this directory to your Unreal project directory you can use the scripts to upload changes to our server.
(Note that all of this can also be done directly in the Unreal Engine editor, but this may be a simpler alternative.)

Use PerforceLogin.bat once each time you log in on a computer.

Use PerforceAddUnrealFiles.bat (the first time you upload a project) or PerforceReconcileUnrealFiles.bat (later on) to register changes.

Use PerforceSubmit.bat to submit/upload registered changes.
